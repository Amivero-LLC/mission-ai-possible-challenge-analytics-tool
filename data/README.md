# Data Directory

This directory contains data files used by the Mission AI Possible Challenge Analytics Tool. Most files in this directory are automatically generated and excluded from git tracking.

## Required Files

### SubmittedActivityList.csv (REQUIRED)

This file **must be manually uploaded** to this directory for the `scripts/combine.py` credit comparison script to work.

**Purpose**: Contains awarded credit information from the activity tracking system to compare against completed challenges.

**Required Columns**:
- `Email` - User email address
- `MissionChallenge` - Name of the mission/challenge
- `ActivityStatus` - Status of the activity (should include "Review Completed" for awarded credits)
- `PointsAwarded` - Number of points awarded

**Example Format**:
```csv
Email,MissionChallenge,ActivityStatus,PointsAwarded,SubmittedDate
user@example.com,Intel Guardian,Review Completed,50,2025-10-15
user@example.com,Prompt Qualification,Review Completed,30,2025-10-16
```

## Auto-Generated Files (Git Ignored)

The following files are automatically generated by the application and are excluded from git:

- `*.json` - Cached API responses (users, models, chats)
- `*.csv` - Chat exports and analysis data
- `*.xlsx` - Excel exports (use `exports/` folder for generated reports instead)
- `all-chats-export-*.json` - Chat history exports from Open WebUI

## File Organization

- **Required manual uploads**: `SubmittedActivityList.csv`
- **Auto-generated cache**: `users.json`, `models.json`, `chats.json`, `fetch_metadata.json`
- **Generated reports**: Moved to `exports/` folder (not tracked in git)

## Important Notes

1. **Do not commit** auto-generated data files to git
2. **Always ensure** `SubmittedActivityList.csv` is present before running credit comparison scripts
3. **Check file permissions** if you encounter access errors
4. **Backup important data** before regenerating cache files

## Getting Data Files

- **Open WebUI Data**: Configure API credentials (OPEN_WEBUI_HOSTNAME, OPEN_WEBUI_API_KEY) to automatically fetch and cache data
- **Activity Credits**: Manually download and place `SubmittedActivityList.csv` in this directory
